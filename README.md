General information about this generated project "*zoorestified*".

## About

This file contains a brief description of system prerequisites, project layout and useful commands for project building / execution.

## Prerequisites

System requirements to build and run the project code.

### Java

The syntax of the generated Java sources requires JDK 8 or higher. JDK-12 is recommended. Make sure to install a compatible JDK version. (You can query the current version with ```java -version```)

Java installation instructions by OS:

 * Windows: [Oracle Download Page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
 * Mac: ```brew cask install adoptopenjdk12``` (See [instructions here](https://brew.sh/) for installation of the ```brew``` command)
 * Linux: ```sudo apt install openjdk-12-jdk```

### Maven

The project sources follow a Maven layout. Maven is also required to build and run this project. Before you continue, make sure that [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is installed on your system. (You can query the current version with ```mvn -version```)

Maven installation instructions by OS:

 * Maven installation instructions for Windows: See [Maven Setup Instructions](https://mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/)
 * Maven installation command for [Brew](https://brew.sh/) / Mac OS Users:  ```brew install maven```
 * Maven installation command for Ubuntu / Linux Users:  ```sudo apt install maven```

## Project Layout

The contents of this generated folder follow a regular maven project structure.

 * Java source files are in ```src/main/java```
 * Compiled builds are in ```target```
 * Maven configuration file is ```pom.xml```


## Build Instructions

This section provides information on how to build and run the generated code.

### Dependencies

Your project depends on the following maven-external JARs:

```bash
    Dependency:
        GroupId: eu.kartoffelquadrat
        ArtifactId: zoo
        Version: 1.0
    
```

Dependencies registered in the [official maven central](https://mvnrepository.com/) are automatically resolved at compile time. All remaining dependencies must be sideloaded to your **local** maven repository. Search the dependencies' READMEs for corresponding instructions.


### Building this project

You can either build the sources into a self contained JAR, or run the compiled code directly:

 * Run from JAR:
```
mvn clean package
java -jar target/-1.0.0.jar
```

 * Run directly:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
